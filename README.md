# ytSpeed
A simple chrome extension to adjust the playback speed of YouTube videos via keyboard shortcuts. Sure you can adjust to 2x (with a mouse), but sometimes that's just not fast enough.

### Status

### Usage

>faster: "Alt+Shift+X"
>slower: "Alt+Shift+Z"
>normal: "Alt+A"

Suggested keybindings are as follows:
>faster: "Alt+X"
